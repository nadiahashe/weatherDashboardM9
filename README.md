Description
The Weather Dashboard is a practical application that connects real-world data to user needs, providing an intuitive way to access weather forecasts. This project was developed to gain hands-on experience in integrating APIs and building a full-stack web application.

With the help of OpenWeatherMap's API, this dashboard allows users to check real-time weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city. It tackles the everyday question: "What's the weather today or tomorrow?" This project showcases skills in fetching, processing, and displaying API data while creating a user-friendly interface.
